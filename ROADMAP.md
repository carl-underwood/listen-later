# Roadmap

## 1.2.0

List filtering & ordering (e.g. the ability to filter out items marked as listened to).

## 1.3.0

Support for other Spotify markets.

Listen Later currently only supports searching Spotify for songs etc. available to the United Kingdom market. This means that if your Spotify account "Country or region" is not "United Kingdom", items added to your Listen Later list may not necessarily be available in your region.

We aim to introduce best-effort market detection and manual selection.

## Considering for later versions

- Support for viewing the list offline.

## Got an idea / suggestion?
