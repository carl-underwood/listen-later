		<h1 class="h1">Terms of Use</h1>
		<h2 class="h2">About the Terms of Use</h2>
		<p>These Terms of Use describe what you can expect from Listen Later ("the application").</p>
		<p>They apply to usage of Listen Later on any device.</p>
		<h2 class="h2">Accepting the Terms</h2>
		<p>
			Usage of Listen Later assumes agreement to these terms. The application may not be used if
			these terms are not agreed to.
		</p>
		<h2 class="h2">Using Listen Later</h2>
		<p>
			Listen Later is free to use, we only ask that you don't abuse it. This includes (but is not
			limited to, and beyond reasonable use) generating excessive volumes of data in the
			application, triggering excessive numbers of requests to the application, and carrying out
			excessive numbers of searches.
		</p>
		<h2 class="h2">Termination of Accounts</h2>
		<p>
			On becoming aware of any potential violation of these terms, Listen Later reserve the right to
			terminate the accounts of any users involved without prior notice.
		</p>
		<h2 class="h2" id="termination-of-hosting">Termination of Hosting</h2>
		<p>
			As Listen Later is provided as a free to use application, it is possible that a time may arise
			when the application can no longer be maintained and the hosting of the application must be
			terminated. For example, if the hosting and maintenance of the application begin to incur
			financial cost to any contributor to the open-source Listen Later project, the decision may
			have to be made to terminate hosting of the application.
		</p>
		<p>
			Listen Later is open-source, meaning that the code required to build and run the application
			is freely available in the <a
				href="https://github.com/carl-underwood/listen-later"
				class="underline">Listen Later GitHub repository</a
			>. As such, in the event that hosting of the application must be terminated, it may be
			possible to self-host a version of the application if desired.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the event that hosting of the application must be terminated, Listen Later will endeavour
			to contact you as a user of the application, and provide a mechanism with which to extract
			your list so as to avoid total loss of data. This should be understood as a best endeavour,
			and Listen Later makes no guarantees and accepts no liability for loss of data.
		</p>
		<h2 class="h2">Limits on Liability</h2>
		<p>
			Listen Later is provided as a free to use application, maintained using reasonable care and
			skill. The application (and its open-source codebase) is, however, provided "as-is". No
			guarantees are made that the application (and its open-source codebase) will always be secure,
			error free, or that it will function without disruptions, delays or imperfections.
		</p>
		<p>
			To the extent permitted by law, Listen Later (including all contributors) disclaims all
			warranties, whether express, implied or statutory. Warranties are also disclaimed on the part
			of third parties, including Spotify (see the <a
				href="https://www.spotify.com/uk/legal/end-user-agreement/"
				class="underline">Spotify Terms of Use</a
			>) and GitHub (with regards to accessibility of the open-source Listen Later codebase - see
			the
			<a
				href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service"
				class="underline">GitHub Terms of Service</a
			>).
		</p>
		<p>
			The liability of Listen Later (including all contributors) shall be limited to the full extent
			permitted by law. Listen Later (including all contributors) will under no circumstances be
			liable for loss of use, business, profits (whether direct or indirect), revenues, information
			or data arising from the use or inability to use the application. Liabilities are also
			disclaimed on the part of third parties, including Spotify (see the <a
				href="https://www.spotify.com/uk/legal/end-user-agreement/"
				class="underline">Spotify Terms of Use</a
			>).
		</p>
		<h2 class="h2">Third Party Content</h2>
		<p>
			Certain links on the Listen Later website will lead to websites that Listen Later (including
			all contributors) has no control over ("third party content"). Listen Later (including all
			contributors) accepts no responsibility or liability for third party content.
		</p>
		<p>
			Certain content in the application is provided by Spotify ("Spotify Content"). This includes
			(but is not limited to), for example, album artwork. Spotify Content is always attributed with
			the Spotify logo. As per the <a
				href="https://www.spotify.com/uk/legal/end-user-agreement/"
				class="underline">Spotify Terms of Use</a
			>, Spotify Content may not be modified, decompiled, reverse-engineered, disassembled, or
			otherwise reduced. Creation of derivative works based on Spotify Content is also prohibited.
			These prohibitions also apply to the Spotify Platform and Spotify Service.
		</p>
		<h2 class="h2">Third Party Rights</h2>
		<p>
			You acknowledge and agree that Spotify is an intended beneficiary of these terms and has the
			right to enforce these terms directly against you.
		</p>
		<p>
			Other than as set out in this section, these Terms are not intended to grant rights to anyone
			except you and Listen Later, and in no event shall these Terms create any third-party
			beneficiary rights.
