A web application for storing things to listen to later on Spotify. Built using SvelteKit & Firebase.

## Dependencies

### Dev Container

Configuration has been added to the `.devcontainer` directory to allow for development to be carried out in a Docker container, avoiding the need to install specific development dependencies for this project on the host machine. For more information on Dev Containers, see [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/) & [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

`devcontainer.json` uses the Playwright image (see the [CI / CD section](#ci--cd) below) and installs Java as described in the [Firebase Tools section](#firebase-tools) below. It also describes the extensions and settings for VS Code, as well as a `postCreateCommand` that sets up the container ready for the project to be run. The only manual intervention required before running `npm run dev` is to place the `.env` files as described in the [`.env` files section](#env-files) below.

#### Performance

When first attempting to use a Dev Container, the exposed <http://localhost:5000> port when running `npm run dev` was very slow, there were also issues with running the Firebase Functions emulator, which appeared to be due to the emulator timing out when attempting to read the functions defined in code. The [Improve disk performance article](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/improve-performance) notes:

> The Dev Containers extension uses "bind mounts" to source code in your local filesystem by default. While this is the simplest option, on macOS and Windows, you may encounter slower disk performance when running commands like yarn install from inside the container.

To resolve this, the option ["Store your source code in the WSL 2 filesystem on Windows"](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/improve-performance#_store-your-source-code-in-the-wsl-2-filesystem-on-windows) was selected as a best fit for my personal development workflow, however ["Use Clone Repository in Container Volume"](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/improve-performance#_use-clone-repository-in-container-volume) was also tested and seemed to resolve the issue too.

### Firebase Tools

Firebase Tools are required for local emulators:

```bash
npm i -g firebase-tools
```

[Java](https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/downloads/) is also required to run the emulators locally.

### .env files

A `.env` file should be introduced in the project root as well as in `./functions`. See the `.env.example` files in those locations to see the values that are required.

## Developing

Once Firebase Tool are installed (and dependencies in general have been installed via `npm i`), the application (including required emulators) may be run using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
npm run build --workspace ./functions
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview` (updated from `vite preview` to `firebase emulators:start` - allowing the built site to be previewed via the Firebase Hosting emulator).

## Testing

To run the integration tests locally, ensure your're running in dev mode (`npm run dev`) or hosting the built site (via `npm run build && npm run preview`).

The tests may then be run via `npm run test:integration`. Since App Check is used to protect the application, a `PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APPCHECK_DEBUG_TOKEN` will need to be set in `.env` (App Check is also inforced on Firestore Database, however when running the emulators this doesn't appear to cause issues).

Unit tests may be run via `npm run test:unit`.

Smoke tests also exist, and can be run via `npm run test:smoke`. These are run in the GitHub Actions "merge" workflow to verify the configuration and functionality of the production application (on <https://listenlater.cloud>) post-deployment. Since App Check is used to protect the application, a `FIREBASE_APPCHECK_DEBUG_TOKEN` will need to be set in `smoke-tests/.env`. `MAILINATOR_API_TOKEN` will also need to be set in `smoke-tests/.env` as the tests result in a sign in link being sent to an `@listenlater.testinator.com` inbox. The tests then fetch this email in order to click the link and sign in.

Finally, a test exists to generate the screenshots used on the home and about pages. This test is not run in the CI / CD workflows, and can be run manually via `npm run generate-screenshots`. This will save the screenshots in the `src/assets` directory.

## CI / CD

The `.github/workflows` directory contains the GitHub Actions workflows that are run on PR & merge.

`build-and-test.yml` is a reusable workflow that's run on PR as well as on merge. It lints, builds and tests the site and functions against the Firebase Emulators. The [Playwright image](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci#via-containers) `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble` is used to avoid the overhead of installing browsers and dependencies on each run. Since this container doesn't have Java installed (which is required for the Firebase Emulators to run) the `actions/setup-java@v4` step is used to install Java.

`merge-1.0.x.yml` first runs the job from `build-and-test.yml`, before deploying the site to Firebase and running smoke tests against the deployed site.

## Favicons

The favicons were generated using [https://realfavicongenerator.net/](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) from the SVG logos in [listen-later-logo-bordered.svg](./listen-later-logo-bordered.svg) and [listen-later-logo.svg](./listen-later-logo.svg).

These logos were created using [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com/) and were based on Material Symbols icons [More Time](https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Symbols+Outlined:more_time:FILL@0;wght@400;GRAD@0;opsz@48&icon.query=clock) and [Headphones](https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Symbols+Outlined:headphones:FILL@1;wght@400;GRAD@0;opsz@48&icon.query=music&icon.set=Material+Symbols).
